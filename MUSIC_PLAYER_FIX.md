# Music Player Fix: Queue to Player Integration

## Issue
Songs were appearing in the queue with "Now Playing" status but not actually playing in the music player.

## Root Cause
The QueueManager component was receiving `current-song-update` events from the backend but only updating the local state. It wasn't triggering the actual audio playback in the audio store.

## Fix Applied

### QueueManager.tsx Changes
1. **Imported audio playback function**: Added `play` and `currentSong` from `useAudio()` hook
2. **Enhanced current-song-update handler**: 
   - Now actually triggers playback when a new current song is received
   - Converts queue item format to searchResults format for audio store compatibility
   - Added duplicate check to prevent restarting the same song
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

### Flow Now Works As:
1. **Add Song**: User adds song to queue via WebSocket
2. **Backend Processing**: Backend adds to queue and triggers auto-play if queue was empty
3. **Backend Auto-play**: Backend calls `adminPlayNext` and sends `current-song-update` event
4. **Frontend Reception**: QueueManager receives `current-song-update` event
5. **Playback Trigger**: QueueManager converts song format and calls `play()` function
6. **Audio Store**: Audio store handles actual playback (YouTube/Spotify)

### Key Code Changes
```typescript
case 'current-song-update':
  console.log('ðŸŽ¶ Current song update:', data.song);
  setCurrentPlaying(data.song || null);
  
  if (data.song) {
    // Check if this song is already playing to avoid restarting
    const isSameSong = audioCurrentSong?.id === data.song.id;
    if (isSameSong) {
      console.log('ðŸŽµ Same song already playing, skipping playback restart');
      break;
    }
    
    // Convert queue format to audio store format and trigger playback
    const audioSong = { /* converted format */ };
    play(audioSong);
  }
  break;
```

## Testing
The fix should now properly:
1. âœ… Show songs in queue
2. âœ… Mark current song as "Now Playing"
3. âœ… Actually start audio playback when song becomes current
4. âœ… Handle auto-play for first song added to empty queue
5. âœ… Prevent duplicate playback of same song

## Backend Flow (Already Working)
- Backend receives `add-to-queue` with `autoPlay: true` for first song
- Backend adds song to queue and calls `adminPlayNext` with 1-second delay
- Backend sends `current-song-update` event to all clients
- Frontend now properly handles this event to start playback
