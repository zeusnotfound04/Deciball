# Song Selection and Queue Addition Fixes

## Summary
Fixed the collaborative music room app to properly handle song selection, batch selection, and WebSocket-based queue management.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend URL Validation
**Problem**: The backend was rejecting YouTube video IDs sent from the frontend with "Invalid music URL" error.

**Solution**: Updated `YoutubeHandler.validateURL()` method to properly validate both:
- Full YouTube URLs (`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`)
- 11-character YouTube video IDs (`VIDEO_ID`)

**Files Changed**:
- `ws/src/handlers/YoutubeHandler.ts`

### 2. Frontend URL Format Consistency
**Problem**: The frontend was inconsistently sending either full YouTube URLs or just video IDs.

**Solution**: Modified the Search component to always send full YouTube URLs to the backend:
- Single song selection: Always creates `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=${videoId}` format
- Batch selection: Converts each video ID to full YouTube URL
- Added better logging and error handling

**Files Changed**:
- `next-app/app/components/Search.tsx`

### 3. YouTube Player Integration
**Problem**: The YouTube player in `PlayerCover.tsx` wasn't properly extracting video IDs from URLs.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `onPlayerReady` function to:
- Extract video IDs from both full URLs and existing IDs
- Validate video ID format before loading
- Better error handling and logging

**Files Changed**:
- `next-app/app/components/PlayerCover.tsx`

### 4. MusicRoom Integration
**Problem**: Duplicate queue addition logic in MusicRoom was conflicting with Search component.

**Solution**: Simplified the `handleBatchAddToQueue` function to just log completion since the Search component handles all queue operations internally.

**Files Changed**:
- `next-app/components/MusicRoom.tsx`

## Technical Flow

### Spotify → YouTube Conversion
1. User searches songs via Spotify API (Search.tsx)
2. User selects song(s) from search results
3. Frontend calls `/api/spotify/getTrack` to get YouTube video ID
4. Frontend creates full YouTube URL: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=${videoId}`
5. Frontend sends via WebSocket: `add-to-queue` with YouTube URL
6. Backend validates URL and extracts video ID
7. Backend adds song to queue
8. YouTube player loads video using extracted ID

### Single Song Selection
- Click on song → Convert to YouTube URL → Send via WebSocket → Add to queue

### Batch Selection (Admin Only)
- Select multiple songs → Convert each to YouTube URL → Send each via WebSocket → All added to queue

## Testing
1. **Single Song Selection**: Search for a song and click to add - should work without "Invalid music URL" error
2. **Batch Selection**: As admin, select multiple songs and click "Add Selected" - all should be added
3. **YouTube Playback**: Songs should play correctly in the YouTube player
4. **WebSocket Communication**: Check browser console for successful queue additions

## Error Handling
- Invalid video IDs are caught and logged
- Network errors show user-friendly messages
- WebSocket connection issues are detected and reported
- Room ID validation prevents orphaned requests

## Next Steps
- Verify new joiners see and sync with current playing song
- Test edge cases (network failures, invalid songs, etc.)
- Monitor WebSocket performance with multiple users
