# Song Selection and New User Synchronization Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Song Selection in Search Component Not Working

**Problem**: When users selected songs from the search component, the songs were being played directly instead of being added to the collaborative queue, bypassing the proper WebSocket-based queue management system.

**Root Cause**: The `handleTrackSelect` function was calling the audio store's `play()` function directly, which started immediate playback without going through the room's queue system.

**Solution**:
- Modified the Search component to use WebSocket communication directly via `sendMessage()`
- Changed the flow from direct playback to adding songs to the queue
- The song selection now properly sends an "add-to-queue" WebSocket message with the correct data format
- Backend handles the queue addition and broadcasts updates to all room members

**Files Changed**:
- `next-app/app/components/Search.tsx`: Updated `handleTrackSelect()` to use WebSocket messaging
- `next-app/store/audioStore.tsx`: Improved `addToQueue()` function with better URL processing and error handling

### 2. New Users Not Seeing Current Playing Song

**Problem**: When new users joined a room where a song was already playing, they couldn't see or hear the current song even though it was playing for the admin/other users.

**Root Cause**: 
1. The room join event wasn't properly including the current song information in the playback state
2. The frontend wasn't correctly handling and formatting the current song data for new joiners
3. Missing event listeners for current song updates

**Solution**:
- **Backend**: Enhanced `sendRoomInfoToUser()` to include current song data in the playback state object
- **Frontend**: Improved socket event handling to properly format and display current song information
- Added `current-song-update` event handling in both socket context and audio store
- Fixed data format conversion between backend and frontend song representations

**Files Changed**:
- `ws/src/managers/streamManager.ts`: Enhanced `sendRoomInfoToUser()` to include current song in playback state
- `next-app/context/socket-context.tsx`: Added proper handling for room-joined and current-song-update events
- `next-app/store/audioStore.tsx`: Added event listener for current-song-update events

## Key Improvements

### Real-time Synchronization
- New users now receive complete room state including current song and playback position
- Proper event-driven architecture ensures all users stay synchronized
- Fixed type compatibility issues in the audio store

### Better WebSocket Integration
- Search component now uses proper WebSocket communication for queue management
- Eliminated bypass of collaborative features when adding songs
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

### Enhanced Data Flow
1. **Song Selection**: Search → WebSocket → Backend → Queue Update → All Users
2. **New User Join**: Backend → Current State → Frontend → Sync Playback
3. **Current Song Updates**: Backend → WebSocket → All Users → Audio Store

## Testing Scenarios

To verify the fixes work properly:

1. **Song Selection Test**:
   - Open search component
   - Select a song
   - Verify it appears in the queue (not immediate playback)
   - Verify all users in the room see the queue update

2. **New User Join Test**:
   - Have admin start playing a song
   - Have new user join the room
   - Verify new user sees current song and playback position
   - Verify audio synchronization works correctly

3. **Queue Management Test**:
   - Add multiple songs via search
   - Verify proper queue ordering and voting
   - Test admin play-next functionality

## Architecture Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Search handles song discovery, WebSocket handles room communication, audio store handles playback
- **Scalability**: Event-driven architecture supports multiple concurrent rooms
- **Consistency**: All users receive the same events and state updates
- **Reliability**: Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

The fixes ensure that the collaborative music experience works seamlessly for all users, whether they're joining an active session or starting a new one.
