# SpaceId and Batch Selection Fixes

## Summary
Fixed the issue where `spaceId` was not being found and batch selection wasn't working properly in the Search component.

## Problem
- Search.tsx was trying to extract `spaceId` from URL parameters using `window.location.search.get("space")`
- This was failing and causing "❌ No spaceId found" error
- Batch selection for admins wasn't working due to missing spaceId

## Solution
Changed the approach to pass `spaceId` as a prop from the parent MusicRoom component instead of extracting it from URL.

### Files Changed

#### 1. Search.tsx
**Changes:**
- Added `spaceId?: string` to `SearchSongPopupProps` interface
- Added `spaceId = ''` to function parameters with default value
- Replaced URL extraction with prop usage in both `handleTrackSelect` and `handleAddSelectedToQueue`
- Enhanced logging to show spaceId status and batch selection debugging

**Before:**
```typescript
const spaceId = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("space") || "";
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Use spaceId prop instead of extracting from URL
if (!spaceId) {
  console.error("❌ No spaceId provided as prop");
  setError('Room ID not found. Please rejoin the room.');
  return;
}
```

#### 2. MusicRoom.tsx
**Changes:**
- Added `spaceId={spaceId}` prop to SearchSongPopup component

**Before:**
```tsx
<SearchSongPopup 
  // ... other props
  enableBatchSelection={isAdmin}
/>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<SearchSongPopup 
  // ... other props
  enableBatchSelection={isAdmin}
  spaceId={spaceId}
/>
```

## Technical Flow

### Single Song Selection
1. User clicks on a song in search results
2. `handleTrackSelect` is called with track data
3. If not in batch mode: immediately converts to YouTube URL and sends via WebSocket
4. Uses `spaceId` prop to identify the room

### Batch Selection (Admin Only)
1. Admin enables batch selection mode
2. Clicking songs toggles selection (adds/removes from `selectedTracks` array)
3. Admin clicks "Add Selected" button
4. `handleAddSelectedToQueue` processes each selected track
5. Each track is converted to YouTube URL and sent via WebSocket
6. Uses `spaceId` prop to identify the room

## Debugging Features Added
- Enhanced console logging shows:
  - Whether batch selection is enabled
  - Current selection count
  - SpaceId status (present/missing)
  - Track selection/deselection events
  - URL conversion process

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- ✅ Single song selection should work without spaceId errors
- ✅ Batch selection should work for admins
- ✅ Multiple songs can be selected and added to queue
- ✅ Clear console logs for debugging any remaining issues

## Testing
1. **Single Selection**: Search for a song, click it → should add to queue immediately
2. **Batch Selection**: As admin, search for songs, click multiple to select them, then click "Add X to Queue"
3. **Console Logs**: Check browser console for detailed operation logs
4. **Error Handling**: Verify graceful handling when spaceId is missing
