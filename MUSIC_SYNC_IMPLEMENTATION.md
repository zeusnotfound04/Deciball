# MUSIC SYNCHRONIZATION IMPLEMENTATION

## Summary

We have successfully implemented a robust, in-memory music synchronization system that avoids frequent database writes and provides real-time playback synchronization for collaborative music rooms.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **In-Memory Playback State Management**
- **Location**: `ws/src/managers/streamManager.ts`
- **Data Structure**: Each space maintains a `PlaybackState` object containing:
  - `currentSong`: Current playing song details
  - `startedAt`: Unix timestamp when song started
  - `pausedAt`: Unix timestamp when paused (null if playing)
  - `isPlaying`: Boolean playback state
  - `lastUpdated`: Last state update timestamp

### 2. **Real-Time Synchronization Methods**
- `pausePlayback()`: Handles pause events and broadcasts to all users
- `resumePlayback()`: Handles resume events and adjusts timing
- `seekPlayback()`: Handles seek events and synchronizes position
- `getCurrentPlaybackTime()`: Calculates current position from timestamps
- `getPlaybackState()`: Provides complete state for new joiners

### 3. **New User Synchronization**
- **Location**: `sendRoomInfoToUser()` method
- When users join a room with active playback:
  - Fetches current playback state from memory (not database)
  - Calculates exact timestamp where new user should start
  - Sends `room-joined` event with sync data

### 4. **Frontend Integration**
- **Location**: `next-app/context/socket-context.tsx`
- WebSocket event handlers for:
  - `room-joined`: Syncs new users to current playback position
  - `playback-paused`: Pauses all user players
  - `playback-resumed`: Resumes all user players
  - `playback-seeked`: Seeks all user players to new position

### 5. **Audio Store Synchronization**
- **Location**: `next-app/store/audioStore.tsx`
- Methods added:
  - `handleRoomSync()`: Syncs new users to room playback state
  - `syncPlaybackToTimestamp()`: Seeks YouTube/Spotify players to exact time
  - `handlePlaybackPause()`: Pauses local players
  - `handlePlaybackResume()`: Resumes local players
  - `handlePlaybackSeek()`: Seeks local players

## Database Changes

### Removed Synchronization Fields
- Removed timestamp tracking fields from `CurrentStream` model:
  - `startedAt`, `pausedAt`, `currentTime`, `lastUpdated`
- Database now only stores which song is current, not playback state
- All synchronization data is kept in memory for performance

## Performance Benefits

### ✅ **Optimized Approach**
- **Zero database writes** for timestamp updates
- **In-memory state** provides instant access
- **Real-time synchronization** via WebSocket events
- **Scalable** - no database bottlenecks

### ❌ **Previous Problematic Approach**
- Database writes every second for progress updates
- High database load and potential bottlenecks
- Slower synchronization due to database round trips

## How It Works

### When a Song Starts Playing:
1. `adminPlayNext()` updates in-memory `PlaybackState`
2. Sets `startedAt` to current timestamp
3. Marks `isPlaying: true`
4. Broadcasts to all users via WebSocket

### When a New User Joins:
1. `sendRoomInfoToUser()` gets current `PlaybackState`
2. Calculates exact current timestamp: `getCurrentPlaybackTime()`
3. Sends `room-joined` event with `shouldStartAt` timestamp
4. Frontend syncs YouTube/Spotify player to exact position

### When Playback is Paused/Resumed:
1. Updates `pausedAt` timestamp and `isPlaying` state
2. Adjusts `startedAt` on resume to account for pause duration
3. Broadcasts state change to all users
4. All players pause/resume simultaneously

### When User Seeks:
1. Updates `startedAt` to reflect new position
2. Broadcasts seek event with new timestamp
3. All players seek to the new position

## WebSocket Events

### Client → Server:
- `pause-playback`: Request to pause current song
- `resume-playback`: Request to resume current song  
- `seek-playback`: Request to seek to specific timestamp
- `get-playback-state`: Request current playback state

### Server → Client:
- `room-joined`: Sent to new users with sync data
- `playback-paused`: Broadcast when song is paused
- `playback-resumed`: Broadcast when song is resumed
- `playback-seeked`: Broadcast when song position changes
- `playback-state-update`: General state updates

## Testing the Implementation

To test the synchronization:

1. **Start a song** in a room
2. **Join with another user** - they should start at the correct timestamp
3. **Pause/resume** - all users should sync
4. **Seek** - all users should jump to the new position
5. **Check console logs** for synchronization events

## File Structure

```
ws/src/managers/streamManager.ts     # Backend synchronization logic
next-app/context/socket-context.tsx  # WebSocket event handling
next-app/store/audioStore.tsx        # Frontend audio synchronization
```

This implementation provides smooth, real-time music synchronization without any database performance issues!
